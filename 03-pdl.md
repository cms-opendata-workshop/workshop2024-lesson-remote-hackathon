## Particle Discovery Lab

The goal of this exercise is to reconstruct decays of an unknown particle X (initial state) to 2 muons (final state). Participants will display histograms for the calculated mass of particle X and learn about fitting and subtracting background distributions from data.

Uncertainty propagation concepts are included at each step of the analysis. After isolating the signal distribution, participants will determine which particle they have discovered and compare its properties (mass and width) to known values.

### Get Ready

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure that the `my_python` container is ready. Refer to the pre-exercise instructions for Docker setup and container creation.
   
2. **Set Up and Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   - Execute the following commands in your terminal:

     ```sh
     docker start -i my_python
     mkdir Particle_Discovery_Lab
     cd Particle_Discovery_Lab
     git clone https://github.com/DanielaMerizalde/CMS-Workshop.git
     cd ..
     jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
     ```

   - After running the last command, open the provided link in your browser to access Jupyter Lab.

3. **Verify Files**:
   - Ensure that the following files are present in the `Particle_Discovery_Lab` directory after cloning the repository:
     - `pollsf.py`
     - `Particle_Discovery_Lab.ipynb`
     - `DoubleMuParked_100K.pkl`

### Instructions for the Exercise

1. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   - In Jupyter Lab, navigate to `Particle_Discovery_Lab.ipynb` from the file menu and open it.

2. **Complete the Notebook**:
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the analysis interactively. You will perform tasks such as plotting histograms, fitting data, and analyzing uncertainties.
