title: Setup
---

This lesson requires a computer with an internet connection and a bash shell (either native Linux, MacOs or Windows WSL2 Linux). You should have Docker installed and the [Docker pre-exercises](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2023-lesson-docker/) finished so that you can access the containers `my_root` and `my_python` created as instructed there.
