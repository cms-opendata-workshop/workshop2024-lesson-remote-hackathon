## Particle Physics Playground

This lesson offers a variety of exercises designed to help undergraduates understand fundamental concepts in particle physics through practical analysis of CMS Open Data.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
## You still have choices!

Just to emphasize, you really only *need* to use ROOT and C++ at the early stages of analyzing CMS Open Data in the AOD (Run 1) or MiniAOD (Run 2) formats. These datasets require using CMS-provided tools that perform much better in C++ than python. However, downstream in your analysis or to analyze Run 2 NanoAOD files, you are welcome to use whatever tools and file formats you choose.
