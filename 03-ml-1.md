# Introduction to Machine Learning in HEP 

Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for extracting insights from complex datasets, making it invaluable in high-energy physics (HEP) research. This lesson introduces participants to applying ML techniques to CMS Open Data, providing a structured approach for beginners with some programming experience.

### Overview

The Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics (HEP) activity bridges the gap between data science and particle physics, utilizing CMS Open Data to explore real-world applications. Participants will learn to leverage ML algorithms to analyze particle collision data, enabling them to classify events, discover new particles, and enhance their understanding of fundamental physics.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into ML in HEP, participants should have a basic understanding of:
- Programming fundamentals (Python recommended)
- Data handling and visualization
- Elementary statistical concepts (mean, variance, etc.)

## Let's get the basics clear 

[Machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. If that is not clear, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RixMPF4xis).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout 

Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.

### Nerual Networks

To have an overview of neural networks, visit [3Blue1Brown's basics of neural networks, and the math behind how they learn](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-networks).

## Data Acquisition and Understanding

By now we must have a basic understanding of how Machine Learning functions, to use this in the realm of High Energy Physics, we must have the following basics.

### CMS Open Data Overview
- Accessing and understanding the CMS Open Data repository.
- Types of datasets available (e.g., AOD, MiniAOD, NanoAOD) and their differences.
- Introduction to the CMS experiment and its detectors.

## Data Preparation

### Cleaning and Preprocessing
- [Handling missing data points and outliers.](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/handling-missing-data-and-outliers-in-machine-learning-challenges-and-solutions-c02b1be2ca36)
- [Normalizing data to ensure consistency across features.](https://www.markovml.com/blog/normalization-in-machine-learning#)
- [Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and correlations.](https://medium.com/@avicsebooks/ml-part-7-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-8b781adfce51)

As you dive into the hackathon, keep in mind that feature engineering—like selecting relevant features, creating new ones to enhance model performance, and using dimensionality reduction techniques play a crucial role in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Mastering these techniques will significantly impact your models' ability to learn from and make sense of your data, so be sure to leverage them effectively in your projects!

## Supervised Learning in HEP

### Basics of Supervised Learning
- Understanding labeled datasets and target variables.
- Classification tasks: distinguishing particle types (e.g., muons, electrons).
- Regression tasks: a possible application in HEP can be predicting particle properties (e.g., energy, momentum).

### Model Selection and Training
- [Choosing appropriate algorithms](https://www.simplilearn.com/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers-need-to-know-article) (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks).
- [Cross-validation techniques](https://www.turing.com/kb/different-types-of-cross-validations-in-machine-learning-and-their-explanations) to optimize model performance.
- [Hyperparameter tuning](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/hyperparameter-tuning-overview) to fine-tune model behavior.

### Model Evaluation
- [Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-machine-learning-algorithm-f10ba6e38234): accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Confusion matrices and [ROC curves](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) for performance visualization.
- Interpreting results and refining models based on feedback: Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt5DwCuYY5c&t) for Learning Curves In Machine Learning explanation.
