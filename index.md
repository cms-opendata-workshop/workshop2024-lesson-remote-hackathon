## Welcome to the CMS Open Data Workshop & Hackathon 2024!

### Importance of Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

In the field of particle physics, collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial. The CMS Open Data Workshop & Hackathon aims to foster these values by providing a platform for participants to work together, share insights, and learn from one another. By collaborating on complex problems and sharing our findings, we can push the boundaries of what we know and achieve breakthroughs that would be impossible to accomplish alone.

### The Importance of Open Data and the Open Science Community

Open data is a cornerstone of modern scientific research. By making data freely available to the public, we enable a broader range of scientists and enthusiasts to engage with it, leading to more robust and innovative discoveries. The open science community thrives on transparency, accessibility, and collaboration, and CMS Open Data is a perfect example of these principles in action. Through this hackathon, we aim to demonstrate the power of open data and encourage more people to contribute to the open science movement.

### Direction and Challenges of the Hackathon

During this hackathon, participants will engage in a variety of self-guided lessons that cover different aspects of particle physics, data analysis, and machine learning. Whether you're an undergraduate looking to understand the basics of particle physics or an experienced programmer seeking a challenging project, there is something for everyone.

#### Key Activities

1. **Particle Discovery Lab**: Analyze real particle collision data from the CMS experiment, identify different particles, and perform both basic and advanced data analysis tasks.
2. **Particle Physics Playground**: Explore fundamental concepts in particle physics through practical analysis of CMS Open Data, including studying particle decay patterns and understanding particle properties.
3. **Machine Learning with Open Data**: Apply machine learning techniques to classify different types of particle collisions and gain practical experience in data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
4. **Advanced Generative Challenge**: Tackle generative modeling tasks using older CMS data, create synthetic data, and validate complex models.

By the end of the hackathon, participants will have gained valuable skills and insights into high-energy physics, data analysis, and machine learning. They will also have the opportunity to contribute to the open science community by sharing their findings and collaborating with others.
