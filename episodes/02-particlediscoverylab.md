## Particle Discovery lab (for students!)

Participants will analyze real particle collision data from the CMS experiment. They will identify different particles, such as muons and electrons, by examining the data's characteristics. This exercise helps students understand how physicists discover and study fundamental particles.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
## You still have choices!

Just to emphasize, you really only *need* to use ROOT and C++ at the early stages of analyzing CMS Open Data in the AOD (Run 1) or MiniAOD (Run 2) formats. These datasets require using CMS-provided tools that perform much better in C++ than python. However, downstream in your analysis or to analyze Run 2 NanoAOD files, you are welcome to use whatever tools and file formats you choose.
