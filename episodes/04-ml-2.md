## Practical Application

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and autoencoders are both types of neural networks, but they serve different purposes and have distinct architectures:

### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):

- Purpose: CNNs are primarily used for supervised learning tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
- Architecture: CNNs consist of convolutional layers that apply learnable filters to input data, capturing spatial hierarchies of features. They typically include pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions and dense (fully connected) layers for final classification or regression.
- Training: CNNs are trained with labeled data, optimizing parameters to minimize classification error or regression loss.
- Applications: CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks where spatial relationships and local patterns in data (such as images) are important.


### Autoencoders:

- Purpose: Autoencoders are used for unsupervised learning tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and anomaly detection.
- Architecture: An autoencoder consists of an encoder network that compresses the input data into a latent representation and a decoder network that reconstructs the input from this representation. Convolutional layers can be used in convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) for image data.
- Training: Autoencoders are trained on unlabeled data, learning to reconstruct the input data effectively. They are optimized based on reconstruction error or other metrics that measure the quality of the reconstructed output.
- Applications: Autoencoders are applied in tasks where finding underlying patterns in data or reducing its dimensionality is beneficial, such as in denoising data, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.
Key Differences:

### Supervised vs Unsupervised: 

- CNNs are supervised learning models that require labeled data for training, while autoencoders are unsupervised models that learn from unlabeled data.
- Output: CNNs produce predictions (class labels or regression values) based on input data, whereas autoencoders reconstruct input data or extract meaningful representations from it.
- Use Cases: CNNs are suitable for tasks requiring classification or regression on structured data like images, whereas autoencoders are used for tasks involving data exploration, anomaly detection, or preprocessing.
