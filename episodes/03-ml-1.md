# Introduction to Machine Learning in HEP 

Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for extracting insights from complex datasets, making it invaluable in high-energy physics (HEP) research. This lesson introduces participants to applying ML techniques to CMS Open Data, providing a structured approach for beginners with some programming experience.

### Overview

The Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics (HEP) activity bridges the gap between data science and particle physics, utilizing CMS Open Data to explore real-world applications. Participants will learn to leverage ML algorithms to analyze particle collision data, enabling them to classify events, discover new particles, and enhance their understanding of fundamental physics.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into ML in HEP, participants should have a basic understanding of:
- Programming fundamentals (Python recommended)
- Data handling and visualization
- Elementary statistical concepts (mean, variance, etc.)

### Detailed Concepts and Steps
