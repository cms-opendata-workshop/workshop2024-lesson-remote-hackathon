# Introduction to Machine Learning in HEP 

Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for extracting insights from complex datasets, making it invaluable in high-energy physics (HEP) research. This lesson introduces participants to applying ML techniques to CMS Open Data, providing a structured approach for beginners with some programming experience.

### Overview

The Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics (HEP) activity bridges the gap between data science and particle physics, utilizing CMS Open Data to explore real-world applications. Participants will learn to leverage ML algorithms to analyze particle collision data, enabling them to classify events, discover new particles, and enhance their understanding of fundamental physics.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into ML in HEP, participants should have a basic understanding of:
- Programming fundamentals (Python recommended)
- Data handling and visualization
- Elementary statistical concepts (mean, variance, etc.)

### Detailed Concepts and Steps

## Data Acquisition and Understanding

### CMS Open Data Overview
- Accessing and understanding the CMS Open Data repository.
- Types of datasets available (e.g., AOD, MiniAOD, NanoAOD) and their differences.
- Introduction to the CMS experiment and its detectors.

## Data Preparation

### Cleaning and Preprocessing

- [Normalizing data to ensure consistency across features.](https://www.markovml.com/blog/normalization-in-machine-learning#)
- [Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and correlations.](https://medium.com/@avicsebooks/ml-part-7-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-8b781adfce51)

As you dive into the hackathon, keep in mind that feature engineeringâ€”like selecting relevant features, creating new ones to enhance model performance, and using dimensionality reduction techniques play a crucial role in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Mastering these techniques will significantly impact your models' ability to learn from and make sense of your data, so be sure to leverage them effectively in your projects!

- Confusion matrices and ROC curves for performance visualization.
- Interpreting results and refining models based on feedback.

## Unsupervised Learning in HEP

### Basics of Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) for grouping similar events.
- Anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual data points.
- Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, LDA) for visualizing high-dimensional data.

### Applications in Particle Physics
- Discovering new particles through anomaly detection.
- Grouping events based on similar characteristics (clustering).
- Simplifying complex datasets for further analysis.

## Advanced Topics and Applications
