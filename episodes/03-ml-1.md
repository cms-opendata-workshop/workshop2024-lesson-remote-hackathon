# Introduction to Machine Learning in HEP 

This lesson guides participants through applying machine learning techniques to CMS Open Data. It's designed for those with some programming experience and an interest in machine learning.

### Overview

The Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics (HEP) activity provides participants with an introduction to the exciting intersection of machine learning and particle physics. By leveraging CMS Open Data, participants will learn how to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data, enhancing their analytical skills and understanding of both fields. 

Machine learning plays a crucial role in analyzing vast amounts of data generated by experiments in High-Energy Physics (HEP). It enables researchers to extract meaningful insights, classify particle collisions, and discover new physics phenomena efficiently.

# Data Preparation
A crucial step in any machine learning project is data preparation. Participants will learn how to clean and preprocess CMS Open Data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating training and test datasets.

## Supervised Learning in HEP

- Definition: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input data point is paired with its corresponding target label or output.
- Objective: The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, based on the labeled examples provided during training.
- Examples: Classification (predicting categories), regression (predicting continuous values), and sequence prediction tasks are common supervised learning problems.
- Process: Models are trained using algorithms that minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs, adjusting parameters to improve accuracy.

## Unsupervised Learning in HEP

- Definition: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset, where the algorithm tries to identify patterns, relationships, or structures in the data without explicit guidance.
- Objective: The goal is to explore the data and extract meaningful insights, such as clusters, associations, or anomalies.
- Examples: Clustering (grouping similar data points), anomaly detection (identifying unusual patterns), and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features while preserving important information) are common unsupervised learning tasks.
- Process: Algorithms in unsupervised learning rely on statistical properties of the data to uncover patterns or structures. They do not aim to predict specific outputs but rather to understand the inherent structure of the data.

# Model Training and Evaluation

Participants will gain hands-on experience in training and evaluating machine learning models. This includes selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
