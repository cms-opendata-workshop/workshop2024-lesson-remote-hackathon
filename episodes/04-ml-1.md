## Overview

Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for extracting insights from complex datasets, making it invaluable in high-energy physics (HEP) research. The Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics (HEP) activity bridges the gap between data science and particle physics, utilizing CMS Open Data to explore real-world applications. Participants will learn to leverage ML algorithms to analyze particle collision data, enabling them to classify events, discover new particles, and enhance their understanding of fundamental physics.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into ML in HEP, participants should have a basic understanding of:
- Programming fundamentals (Python recommended)
- Data handling and visualization
- Elementary statistical concepts (mean, variance, etc.)

## Let's get the basics clear 

[Machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. If that is not clear, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RixMPF4xis).

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart". Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions based on data.](../fig/ml-vs-ai.png)

Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.

## Data Acquisition and Understanding

By now we must have a basic understanding of how Machine Learning functions, to use this in the realm of High Energy Physics, we must have the following basics.

**CMS Open Data Overview:**
- Accessing and understanding the CMS Open Data repository.
- Types of datasets available (e.g., AOD, MiniAOD, NanoAOD) and their differences.
- Introduction to the CMS experiment and its detectors.

## Data Preparation - Cleaning and Preprocessing

As you dive into the hackathon, keep in mind that feature engineeringâ€”like selecting relevant features, creating new ones to enhance model performance, and using dimensionality reduction techniques play a crucial role in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Mastering these techniques will significantly impact your models' ability to learn from and make sense of your data, so be sure to leverage them effectively in your projects!

![Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input comes with corresponding output labels, allowing the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures within the data without predefined labels, often used for clustering and association tasks.](../fig/s-vs-us.png)

## Supervised Learning in HEP

#### Basics of Supervised Learning
- Understanding labeled datasets and target variables.
- Classification tasks: distinguishing particle types (e.g., muons, electrons).
- Regression tasks: a possible application in HEP can be predicting particle properties (e.g., energy, momentum).

#### Model Selection and Training
- [Choosing appropriate algorithms](https://www.simplilearn.com/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers-need-to-know-article) (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks).
- [Cross-validation techniques](https://www.turing.com/kb/different-types-of-cross-validations-in-machine-learning-and-their-explanations) to optimize model performance.
- [Hyperparameter tuning](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/hyperparameter-tuning-overview) to fine-tune model behavior.

#### Model Evaluation
- [Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-machine-learning-algorithm-f10ba6e38234): accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Confusion matrices and [ROC curves](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) for performance visualization.
- Interpreting results and refining models based on feedback: Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt5DwCuYY5c&t) for Learning Curves In Machine Learning explanation.

![Confusion metrics, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It displays the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insight into the accuracy, precision, recall, and overall effectiveness of the model's predictions.](../fig/metrics.png)

## Unsupervised Learning in HEP

#### Basics of Unsupervised Learning
- [Clustering algorithms](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-unsupervised-learning?hl=en#) (K-means, DBSCAN) for grouping similar events.
- Anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual data points.
- [Dimensionality reduction](https://www.ibm.com/topics/dimensionality-reduction) methods (PCA, LDA) for visualizing high-dimensional data.

#### Applications in Particle Physics
- Discovering new particles through anomaly detection.
- Grouping events based on similar characteristics (clustering).
- Simplifying complex datasets for further analysis.
