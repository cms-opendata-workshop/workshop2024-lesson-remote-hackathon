## Advanced Generative Challenge

This project is designed for more experienced programmers looking for a challenging activity using older CMS data.

Participants might work on a generative modeling task where they generate synthetic particle collision data that matches the statistical properties of the real data. This helps in understanding complex models and simulations used in high-energy physics.
